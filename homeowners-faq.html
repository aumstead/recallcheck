      <h3 class="faq__question">What is RecallChek?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        RecallChek is a recall reporting service for home appliances, water heaters, furnaces and air conditioners. Utilizing make and model numbers, we identify recalled appliances in about 1 in every 10 homes submitted - all of which are eligible for free, in-home repairs performed by the manufacturer.
      </p>
      <a id="q2" class="faq__anchor"></a>
      <h3 class="faq__question">Why would an appliance be recalled?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        First and foremost, safety. Over 80% of the more than 205 million units recalled throughout the U.S. and Canada were the result of fires. When a manufacturer designs a product, they generally want to control cost to stay price competitive in the marketplace. Oftentimes, this results in working parts such as relays and other electrical components being pushed to their mechanical limits.
      </p>
      <a id="q3" class="faq__anchor"></a>
      <h3 class="faq__question">Won't the manufacturer inform me if there is a free repair available due to recall?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        Rarely, and only if you registered the product with the manufacturer. The problem is that most products are never properly registered. With RecallChek, you can effectively register all your appliances with a group dedicated to ensuring your products are safe.
      </p>
      <a id="q4" class="faq__anchor"></a>
      <h3 class="faq__question">What happens if I have a recall?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        One of two things - under consumer product law, the manufacturer must offer you a free, in-home repair. We provide you with the number to call as well as what hours their offices are open to schedule those repairs. Sometimes the manufacturer will also offer cash in lieu of repair or a credit toward a new unit. This is a great option if you were looking at upgrading or are in the process of remodeling, but is not a requirement.
      </p>
      <a id="q5" class="faq__anchor"></a>
      <h3 class="faq__question">Isn't recall information available at the CPSC web site in the U.S.(or Health Canada)?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        Yes it is! Kind of...<br/><br/>
        RecallChek is the ONLY way to verify whether or not you have recalled products in your home...and continue to receive notifications on just those appliances that you own. In addition to that, the CPSC database has a number of records with inaccurate data - none of which is indexed properly for searching. In a random sampling of 400 homes that have been submitted to RecallChek, 58 of them were found to have recalls. The same 400 were run through the CPSC database and only 1 was found to have a recall.
      </p>
      <a id="q6" class="faq__anchor"></a>
      <h3 class="faq__question">How do I find my model numbers?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">After purchase, an email with instructions and the link to access your RecallChek account will be sent. Model numbers are generally easy to find, and the process of locating and taking them down will take about 5 - 10 minutes. For instance, if you open your dishwasher and look on the door frame, you will find a tag specifying the manufacturer and model number.</p>
      <a id="q7" class="faq__anchor"></a>
      <h3 class="faq__question">Should I input serial numbers?</h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">This is completely optional.
        There are two main reasons you may consider doing so:<br/><br/>
        
        1. The serial number is the most common qualifier for recalls, and it will make your RecallChek report even more accurate.
        <br/><br/>
        2. RecallChek stores your data for life as a part of our ongoing Recall Protection. This can also have the consequential benefit of serving as an inventory should you experience a loss due to peril or theft.
        <br/><br/>
        In fact, the Atlanta Police Department recently utilized a RecallChek report in recovering stolen appliances that were identified by a home owner as stolen and were listed on Craig's List for sale.
      </p>
      <a id="q8" class="faq__anchor"></a>
      <h3 class="faq__question">What are the chances of a recalled appliance being in my home?
      </h3>
      <p class="faq__answer">
        We find about 9.6% of the homes submitted have a recall.<br/><br/>
        There is a fairly good chance you either have one or will in the future, so a RecallChek report with lifetime Recall Protection is a good idea for anyone who owns a home.
        <br/><br/>
        The better question is probably what are the consequences of having a recalled appliance in your home?
        There are two potential consequences:
        <br/><br/>
        a. A fire. It could be a small one, perhaps a small kitchen fire. It could be a whole loss. Either way it is at the very minimum an inconvenience and a homeowner's insurance deductible.
        <br/><br/>
        b. Mechanical failure. This is definitely the more likely consequence, and it happens all the time! Your appliance repair person doesn't know the relay they are replacing over heated because it was not engineered properly. They don't know it's recalled. With RecallChek you get the FREE repair before the premature mechanical failure.
