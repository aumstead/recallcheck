        <p class="testimonial__text">I stumbled on to Nathan and his company because I watch for successful people and tend to follow and ask questions. Although he is a very busy person he picked up the phone the first time I called and spent 30mins + with me explaining how his products help me and my clients. His company has opened my eyes to a whole other level and has given me a path for a successful business. Him and his company is awesome and go way above and beyond to help you in any way and their products are absolutely amazing and help everyone, no matter what side of the transaction you're on. I would definitely recommend him and his company and will be adding more services as times roll on and of course I will be getting more successful through his help.<br/>Thanks so much!</p>

When I woke up at 1300 and opened my email the RecallChek response was waiting for me. I forwarded it to my client and they received it just about 8 hours after they received my inspection report.

        <p class="testimonial__text">P. Nathan Thornberry's new book "Change|Up A Guide To Going Big" is not only big, it is bold, brash and even audacious which is of no surprise with Thornberry's juggernaut approach to anything and everything business. As to be expected, this book is chock full of marketing and business insights for the home inspection business owner. Employing just a fraction of these gems will give you a leg up over the competition. The book is simple and straight forward and in my opinion makes great sense. I don't necessarily have the personality for home inspection world domination nor do I share the "killer instinct" with that of the author. However, this book, much like "The Hungry Home Inspector" - motivates and inspires me to focus on growing my business. I don't get a whole lot of satisfaction from attics, crawl spaces or report writing but I do get satisfaction from making bank deposits. If you're in the home inspection business to make money, this book is a must read.</p>

        <p class="testimonial__text">I recently purchased a home in Palm Coast, Florida working with realtor Bryant Cochran, an agent from 100 Plus Realty Group. Bryant suggested a superb home inspection from House 2 Home Inspection that included a warranty. Just as the warranty was about to expire, the bathroom shower mechanism developed a water leak that was leaking water on the bedroom carpet. The leak was immediately fixed but I left town the next day to attend to a family emergency. My claim was made after the policy expired. I praise RWS who allowed my claim. They went above and beyond the strict "letter of the law."<br/>

          Personally I would like to thank everyone involved. It made my purchase experience go smoothly.

          I am writing this note of appreciation for the quality service provided by RWS SewerGard and staff James Beckley. We had water backing up and slow drains on both bathrooms, (shower drain and toilet) on our new home we had just purchased and moved in caused by roots in the sewer. Thanks to The Elite Group Property Inspection Service when they provided there service to us they informed us about the add on service for new home buyers through RWS SewerGard. If it would not have been for Elite's add on service we would have had to pay out of pocket unexpected amount to have this issue fixed.<br/>
          
          I must say the prompt support by James Beckley and RWS SewerGard was outstanding. He answered all my questions and concerns throughout this unexpected situation we were having. You should certainly feel proud of such resources, who can bring in goodwill for the company.<br/>
          
          I appreciate the way you have trained your staff and fast response to opened claims like mine. Once again thank you for the good service and I wish the company a lot of success.</p>

        <p class="testimonial__text">Hey you guys! GOOD WORK<br/>

          I placed the call to the manufacturer, Maytag, for my client; I simply gave them the model and serial number and the address of the inspection???they came right back with the recalled item, and in this case, the service call and date by authorized dealer here in Tucson; this was quick and the client (and me I might add) were impressed to see that the service works when there is a recall.

          I just want to take a moment to express my appreciation for Inspector Services Group's professionalism and service. Your warranty service provides our clients with peace of mind because it's reassurance that if a mechanical or structural issue occurs after their inspection, a warranty is in place. We are very pleased with this warranty and will continue offering it with our home inspections along with other safe guards you offer, including RecallChek and SewerGard. These create a win/win for our home inspection business and our clients, and we thank you!
          <br/>
          I look forward to our continued business relationship and would not hesitate to recommend your company to other inspectors.

        <p class="testimonial__text">The excitement of my first time home purchase quickly faded to tension and worry after discovering unforeseen underground water pipe issues that were not revealed at the initial home inspection. However, thanks to the advice of my wonderful realtor Flo Abke from Realty Executives Select in St Clair Shores, MI I had a home inspection performed by Hawk Eye Home Inspections that is backed by the amazing SewerGard service of RWS Inspector Services Group. Hawk Eye???s home inspection policy offered a full spectrum of comprehensive coverage that included: a 90-Day Warranty on mechanical and structural issues, a RecallChek comprehensive recall report, and SewerGard protection for underground water and sewer lines. The SewerGard program ended up saving me $2,000.00 after the discovery of damaged pipes leading to the sewer. I cannot stress enough how wonderful it was to have a home inspector that has the backing of such high quality programs like SewerGard. These programs help to provide both the peace of mind and support that all home buyers should have when purchasing a new home. I could not be more pleased with the service that RWS provided throughout the entire claim's process, with both an expedited review as well as helpful and attentive customer service. I would highly recommend Hawk Eye Home Inspections, along with RWS backed services to any home-buyer. It will save you thousands of dollars and give you the peace of mind that only the highest quality of service can provide.

        <p class="testimonial__text">We recently moved in to a house, with the help of some very special people. Our realtor, Ron Plechaty, with Ming Tree Real Estate has been exceptional at meeting our needs, both before and after, moving into our new home. Ron recommended a trustworthy inspection team. Oni Shaw and Wild River Inspections. They not only gave us a complete inspection, but it was backed by a superior warranty service, 90 day Warranty and SewerGard.
          <br/>
          After moving into the house, we discovered that we had a few issues that needed to be taken care of. We talked to Ron and he reminded us that we should contact the 90 day Warranty Service. Oni Shaw and Julie Campbell, with Wild Rivers Inspection were very helpful and encouraging to us about filing a claim with the warranty service. We have been in close contact there with James Beckley, who helped us through that process.
          <br/>
          We had a sewer line problem, and our heat pump broke down. The SewerGard has been a relief to us, as they are taking care of those expenses for us. Underground pipe issues are hard to detect in an inspection, and we are relieved that SewerGard is taking care of our plumbing problems. The company was quick at deciding they could help us with this problem.
          <br/>
          We are grateful that all these people worked together with us to make this move a good one.</p>

        <p class="testimonial__text">I wanted to send you an email to pass along to you and your employees of how happy I am that I discovered all the services that you offer about 13 months ago! I can???t say enough about what RecallChek and the 90 Day Warranty programs have added to my services and the benefits of these services for my clients, but I really wanted to give you a huge shout out on the Google Ads program that I signed up for at your conference last year. I have tried this system with Google before and have had decent results and to tell you the honest truth, I forgot all about signing up for this service thru your company back then.<br/>

          Well, all I can say is that January was my second best month of my career as a Home Inspector and I couldn???t figure out what was causing my phone to ring so much until I received an email today from your employee Katie Smith with the statistics from the Google Ad campaign. I am ranked at 1.6 average position and that sounded pretty good until I called a buddy of mine who is a co-founder of Geek Squad from what he knows about this type of marketing. His first word was ???incredible??? and described what all that meant such as me being at the top of the page instead of the side, etc???all I cared about was the fact that my phone was ringing in January and has been just as consistent in February 2014!
          <br/>

        <p class="testimonial__text">When I contact Michael Doerr I know two things will happen... 1-he will get back to me quickly and 2-he will make sure everything is all-right. All-Right? That's actually an understatement. Michael has ensured my satisfaction and exceeded expectations by far. When I am happy, he finds something else to improve upon. In fact, I have started to feel guilty bringing things to his attention because I don't want Michael to think I am unhappy. He has always made me feel that I am an important client and left me with the impression that his product was customized for me (whether that's actually true or not, I am not sure, but it's a nice feeling). Above all, I am impressed with Michael's demeanor. He is pleasant and approachable. We met in the fall and he didn't pressure me to make a sale - he tried to understand my requirements and listened. He patiently answered questions and by the time we bumped into each other at the airport later on, we were closer to friends than business associates. Michael is a true asset to his company and I recommend him wholeheartedly.</p>

          I just got The Hungry Home Inspector book in the mail. Thanks Nathan. I'm on page 83, and it is amazing, I'm going to be sad when this book is finished. I would like to see you write a book about starting from scratch in this industry, everything from buying tools to education and marketing. I would honestly say that this is one of my all time favorite books, it ranks right next to another favorite read of mine The Automatic Millionaire by David Bach.

          After a year and a half using RecallChek successfully, I got some great feedback. Yesterday a Realtor who uses me was at an inspection. She said her cousin who I did an inspection for had a dishwasher come up on RecallChek. She said the company came out and installed a brand new dishwasher for free. I am a hero for her, and she could not quit praising me and RecallChek. It is so great to know when I tell someone it will be fixed or replaced for free, it really will be so.

          We have been utilizing the RecallChek and 90 Day Warranty (RWS) for some years now. We actually have agents and clients, when calling for a quote, making sure they get these services!
          <br/>
          The word is out around our little area of the Gulf Coast of Alabama. We give these services to our clients at no charge. We appreciate the professionalism and courtesy given to our clients when there is an issue.
          <br/>
          With your help we have grown our business to the point of hiring and training 2 new inspectors and office and marketing assistants because we stay so busy in the field now!!
          <br/>
          We had an inspection company in our town that told some agents and customers that would call for a quote, that the warranty service we offered wasn't worth the paper it was written on. We prove them wrong all the time by getting the jobs they don't!
          <br/>
          Thank you for helping our company grow.

          Nearly all of InterNACHI's most successful members utilize RecallChek, including the largest inspection company in the U.S. and thousands of others in nearly every market. It's so simple and inexpensive to implement, there's really no excuse NOT to offer this service. If you want to know how to make more money in this business, this is it. Differentiating yourself is key, and RecallChek is hands-down the best way to do exactly that. If I were to start an Inspection business tomorrow, the first thing I would do is join InterNACHI. The second thing I would do is sign up for RecallChek.

          Hi Michael Doerr,
          <br/>
          I just wanted to drop you a note and tell you how impressed I am with the RecallChek program. I did an inspection yesterday, a Saturday (not normal), and submitted the RecallChek data late in the afternoon and I told my clients to expect it as early as next week. Imagine my surprise when I opened my e-mail this evening and saw the report within 12 hours. What great service! I'm impressed, and I'm sure my clients are impressed as well.

          Their service provided to my clients & Realtors is outstanding. They treat each claim for the 90 Day Warranty with Professionalism. They are aware of the stresses associated with a claim and they work non-stop to make sure the outcome is positive.<br/>

          The RecallChek is such an outstanding product. One of our Realtors was gathering this information for his clients; now he relies on us and this report, which saves him time!<br/>

          I have great trust in RWS. Their innovation is exciting and I always look forward to learning more about each product they introduce!

          I had one agent that was able to retrieve stolen appliances because of RecallChek, so that agent is sold on the program. (An unintended benefit of the program... having model and serial numbers available)!<br/>
